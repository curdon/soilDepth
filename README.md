# Soil Depth Modelling

This respository contains details on the model used to compute the results as reported in the publication Hunt et al.: "Prediction of soil formation as a function of age using the precolation theory approach", currently under review at [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/).

## Content

This respository contains the R code and the input data with the parameter settings for modelling soil depth in the Alps and in the Medierranian.

The R script works with a small sample of the whole dataset. If computation of the full dataset takes too long on a desktop computer please contact [curdon](https://github.com/curdon) for a faster code, that applies an approximation.
